    <h2>Chapter One: The Uncontacted Tribe</h2>
    <p>
        Somewhere in Africa there is a uncontacted tribe, the primitive tribe people celebrate the season of spring, they write songs for spring and they praise the old giant tree. The mysterious peoples of the lost tribe only show up for a short period for the traditional festival in spring every few years. After the celebration, they disappear like ghost and nobody could find any evidence for their existence.
        <br /><br />
        "Lucas, you are going to Africa to trace the missing tribe and their festival." Lily said.
        <br /><br />
        "Are you serious? Thank you for this opportunity." Lucas replied.
        <br /><br />
        Lucas works for a online media company which can only afford one staff for the trip to Africa, this project is very significant to all of them. The company boss Lily knows deep in her heart this is a game of "all or nothing": it's a golden chance if Lucas could get some juicy first hand news of the unrevealed tribe, or the company goes bankrupt.
        <br /><br />
        The mission for Lucas is to discover the secret ceremony in the festival. This year seems to be the most possible year for the tribe showing up, competitor from all around the world, many media workers fly to Africa with the same purpose, to capture this valuable chance, once in a lifetime...
